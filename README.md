# Watson-React-frontend

Frontend application developed in `React.js` with `Scoket.io` and `Bootstrap.css` for `watson` chatbot assistant.

You just need a backend using `socket.io` to handle the `Client Message` and emit the response though `Server Message`. Everything else is already there to handle the watson json response.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
